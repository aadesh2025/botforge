    in the configuration looking wrong. This is the check that names it. It is the same failure
    family as the `.env`-comment-as-API-key outage (ADR-044) and the `LLM_FORCE_FAKE`-on-8010
    mix-up: **configuration that is correct in dev and silently wrong in production.**

    Returns `(ok, reason)` for the caller's benefit and **never raises**. A diagnostic that can
    stop the API from starting is worse than the bug it reports.

    Two distinct failures, because they need different fixes:

    * the endpoint does not answer  -> the service is missing or the URL is wrong;
    * it answers but does not have the model -> `ollama/ollama` starts EMPTY. It serves an API
      with no models, and embedding against a model it has not pulled is an error rather than a
      download. A port that answers is not evidence that embedding works, which is exactly how a
      "fixed" PROD-2 could still be broken.
