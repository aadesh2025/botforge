"""The attention queue — ask a human to look, without pausing the bot (docs/11 §L6, Phase E).

**`attention` and `handoff` are different states and the distinction is the whole feature.**

    handoff    the bot is PAUSED and a human owns the conversation
    attention  the bot is STILL ANSWERING and a human is asked to look

The operator's requirement is explicit and it is the right call: on `elevated` the AI keeps
working while a person decides whether to step in. A queue that silences the bot every time
someone is angry replaces a bad reply with no reply, and the customer notices the second one
more. Only `crisis` suppresses generation — and even then it emits a written holding message
rather than nothing, because silence in a crisis is the worst outcome of all.

Publishing reuses `trigger_handoff()`'s pattern — the same realtime hub topic and the same
webhook dispatcher — rather than inventing a second channel, so an inbox already subscribed
receives attention events with no extra wiring.
