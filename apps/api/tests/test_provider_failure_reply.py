"""A provider failure must never reach a visitor as an empty reply.

The outage these pin (ADR-044): a malformed API key made Gemini reject every request, so
`run_turn` caught the `ProviderError`, left `result.content` at "", and the widget returned
HTTP 200 with an empty body. An empty string reads as a quiet bot, not an outage, so nobody
noticed — the published agent served nothing to every visitor for an unknown period.

`app/modules/public/service.public_chat_once` only accumulates `token` events, so the error
event it also emitted was dropped on the floor. Producing real text is what makes the failure
visible; the error is still recorded on the result for the log and the persisted message.
